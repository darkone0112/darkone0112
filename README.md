I am constantly learning and expanding my skillset to better serve the company and improve as a developer, or at least that's what I tell myself at night to sleep better. But in reality, I'm just a masochist who enjoys the pain and frustration that comes with programming. Seriously, who in their right mind would willingly choose to spend hours staring at a screen trying to debug code? But hey, at least it pays the bills, right? 

Don't get me wrong, programming can be incredibly satisfying when everything just clicks and the code runs without a hitch. But those moments are few and far between, and are usually followed by days, if not weeks, of head-banging-against-the-wall frustration. But hey, that's just part of the job, right? Embrace the chaos and all that.

And let's not forget about the social interactions, or lack thereof. As a programmer, you'll spend most of your time talking to your computer and your keyboard, developing an intense and one-sided relationship with them. But hey, at least you'll have perfect posture and a great grip, thanks to all the hand cramps you'll develop from coding.

On the other hand, the dopamine rush of learning something new in JavaScript is incomparable, that is until you realize that there's a new framework that does it better. But hey, that's just the nature of the game, right? Keep up or get left behind.

When I first entered this industry, I imagined myself as the next Markus Persson, creating the next Minecraft. But now, here I am, a DevOps developer, making sure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. It's like magic, but not the kind of magic that makes me want to put on a top hat and a cape and make things disappear. More like the kind of magic that makes me want to pull my hair out and make things reappear, like bugs and errors.

In summary, I may hate programming sometimes, but I love it too much to quit.
